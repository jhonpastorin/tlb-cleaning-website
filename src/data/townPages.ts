// Per-town data for the location pages at /locations/<town>/.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and why there is not one .astro file per town:
// the sample Lismore page proved that a location page is one layout with a
// handful of town-specific values swapped through it. Shipping that as 56
// near-identical page files would mean every future copy tweak has to be made
// 56 times, which is exactly the drift locations.ts was extracted to stop
// (four copies of one town list, see its own header). So the layout lives
// once in src/pages/locations/[town].astro and the per-town substance lives
// here.
//
// WHAT A TOWN NEEDS, in order of how much it matters:
//   1. `local`   — the paragraph only true of that town. THE important one.
//                  See the ⚠️ below. Optional in the type, required in
//                  practice before a town's page should be considered done.
//   2. `nearby`  — the suburbs it links out to. Derived by default.
//   3. `hero`    — which of the three region photos it opens on.
// Everything else (region, state, service list, table, FAQs, CTA) is
// identical across towns by design and lives in the route file.
//
// ⚠️ THE DUPLICATE-CONTENT PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED BY THIS FILE. It is only
// made cheap to solve. As shipped, 55 of these 56 towns have no `local`
// paragraph, which means 55 pages that differ by a town name and six suburb
// links. Google calls those doorway pages and the penalty is not scoped to
// the thin pages — it can pull down the whole domain. Two ways out, and TLB
// has to pick one:
//   (a) Write `local` for every town before launch. Two or three sentences
//       each, from someone who works there. That is the version that ranks.
//   (b) Ship only the towns that have one, and leave the rest as unlinked
//       pills (locations.ts already documents how). Ten real pages beat 56
//       thin ones.
// Whoever picks, pick deliberately. Publishing all 56 as they stand is a
// decision too, just an unexamined one.
// THE VALUES LIVE IN PAGES CMS (PAGES-CMS-PLAN.md, Phase 2): one file per town
// in src/content/towns/ ("Locations > Towns"), holding its photo, its `local`
// paragraph and any hand-picked `nearby` list. The region photos are in
// src/content/site/locations.yaml. The rules below about what a photo and its
// description may claim apply to whoever edits those files.

// ── ONE SCENE PER TOWN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every town now opens on its own photo instead of sharing one of the three
// above. The three-photo version was the honest thing to ship when there was
// no per-town imagery, but it meant twenty Northern Rivers pages opened on
// the same weatherboard house: a reader who checks two towns sees the same
// picture twice and correctly reads the whole set as stock.
//
// ⚠️ THE RULE THAT DID NOT CHANGE, AND THE ONE THAT DID.
// Each scene is chosen to be CHARACTERISTIC of its town — cane flats for
// Broadwater, red soil for Cudgen, canals for Burleigh Waters, a rock-shelf
// headland for Fingal Head. None of them is, or claims to be, a photograph
// OF that town. So the labels below still never name a town, a landmark or a
// street: they describe what is in the frame and nothing more. That is the
// whole reason this is publishable. A generated image captioned "the Byron
// Bay lighthouse" is a fabricated claim about a real place; the same image
// captioned "a headland above a curving bay" is a picture of a headland.
//
// Keep that distinction if you edit a label. If TLB shoots real town
// photography later, upload it on the town in Pages CMS and the description
// can finally say where it is.
//
// Regenerate the whole set, or re-shoot one town, with:
//   node scripts/locations/generate.mjs
// (prompts live in scripts/locations/town-scenes.json; delete a town's .jpg
// to re-shoot just that one). A new photo can also be uploaded straight onto
// the town in Pages CMS.
// ⚠️ Lismore deliberately uses the shared Northern Rivers region photo, not a
// Lismore-specific scene: this is TLB's pick. The /locations/ hub shows this
// same photo on its Northern Rivers card, so a reader going hub → Lismore sees
// it twice. That is the one place the repetition this file set out to remove
// still happens.

// FIRST ATTEMPT, AND WHY IT WAS THROWN AWAY: a sliding window over the town's
// position in its region array, on the theory that locations.ts' order is
// roughly geographic. It is roughly geographic WITHIN a sub-area and jumps
// between them, so every town sitting at the start of a cluster got half its
// neighbours from the previous one. Ballina came out linking to Clunes,
// Bexhill and Dunoon: hinterland towns half an hour inland, on the page of a
// beach town. Wrong in a way a local spots instantly and a reader quietly
// distrusts. Don't reintroduce it.
//
// WHAT REPLACED IT: explicit clusters, written out below. Six of these lists
// is a few minutes of work and it is checkable — someone who knows the area
// can read them and say yes or no, which is not true of an index heuristic.
//
// ⚠️ CLUSTERS ARE DRAWN FROM THE MAP, NOT FROM LOCAL KNOWLEDGE. They are
// ordinary geography rather than guesses about TLB's runs, but the person who
// drives these roads should still read them once. A town in the wrong cluster
// is a wrong-looking page, not a broken one.
//
// Every town belongs to exactly one cluster, and every town in a region is in

// being true, so adding a town to locations.ts can't silently produce a page
// with no neighbours.
