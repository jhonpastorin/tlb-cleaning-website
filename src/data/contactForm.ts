// The contact form's options, copy and endpoint — everything about the form
// that is a CONTENT decision rather than markup. ContactForm.astro reads this
// and nothing else; the component stays brand-agnostic the way every other
// section in this library is.
//
// ⚠️ THE FORM IS THE FIRST THING ON THIS SITE THAT CAN LOSE AN ENQUIRY.
// contact.astro's own header spent four paragraphs explaining why it shipped
// WITHOUT a form: "there is no form handler, no endpoint and no backend in
// this project — a form that posted nowhere would silently swallow enquiries,
// which is the worst failure this page could have." That reasoning has not
// been repealed, it has been ANSWERED: the form now posts to an off-site
// webhook (a Zapier catch hook), which creates the item in the Monday.com
// board. See MONDAY-FORM-SETUP.md for the board columns, the scenario and the
// field-by-field mapping.
//
// The one rule that replaces the old "no form" rule: THE FORM MUST NEVER
// REPORT SUCCESS IT DID NOT GET. `enquiryEndpoint` below is empty until a real
// webhook URL is set, the build says so out loud, and the client-side script
// refuses to submit rather than showing a thank-you that means nothing.
// THE COPY AND THE SERVICE OPTIONS LIVE IN PAGES CMS ("Site settings > Contact
// form", src/content/site/contact-form.yaml). The endpoint, the field list and
// the thank-you path stay here: they are wiring, not content.

 * Each row below maps onto a GROUP of menu items rather than a single page:
 *
 *   Regular Home Cleaning        -> the ongoing / one-off domestic clean
 *   Deep Cleaning                -> /house-cleaning/deep-cleaning/
 *   End of Lease / Bond Cleaning -> /house-cleaning/end-of-lease-cleaning/
 *   Airbnb & Holiday Let         -> airbnb-cleaning + real-estate-cleaning
 *   Carpet, Upholstery & Floors  -> the menu's whole "Appliances" column
 *   Outside Home & Exterior      -> the menu's whole "Outside your home" column
 *   NDIS & Assisted Living       -> ndis-cleaning + the unbuilt seniors page
 *   Commercial Cleaning          -> the entire Commercial menu, all 15 pages
 *
 * "Something else" is not padding. Four services are advertised in the menu
 * with no page yet (forensic, hoarder, deceased estate, seniors), and a reader
 * who wants one of those has nothing else to pick. A dropdown with no escape
 * hatch turns those enquiries into bounces.
 *
 * ⚠️ CHANGING A LABEL HERE IS A TWO-PLACE EDIT. These strings are submitted
 * verbatim, and Monday.com's dropdown column silently drops a label it does
 * not already have, so the board's column must be updated in the same sitting.
